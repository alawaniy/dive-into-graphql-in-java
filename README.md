# GraphQL in the Java World  Letâ€™s Go for a Dive

This is code example used in my deep dive talk/tutorial session.

In this talk GraphQL is demonstrated by using Java examples. Both Schema Definiton Language and Query languge of GraphQL are coverd.

Sections of code are organized via branches. 

For demo purposes I am using H2 in memory database. 
In order to connect to local instance of H2 once app is deployed hit url 

http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

Make sure that URL is set to jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
